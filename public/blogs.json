        "ans": "Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more. Server-side technologies nowadays can handle pretty much as long as it is concerned with the cloud, like saving/reading the files, data-security, building a huge database, sending push notifications, as I said, pretty much everything, you just name it."
